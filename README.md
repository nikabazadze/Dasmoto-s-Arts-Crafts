# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

This is the project of the fictional arts and craft's store called Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts, from the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering course.

# Overview
This is the first project to practice basic HTML and CSS. In this project, I have built a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using HMLT5 and CSS3. I was provided with images and design spec for styling the page.
